        <h2>Cream Cheese Pound Cake</h2>
        <span>Pound cake has been around since the 1700’s when it was created in England. Its name is not super creative – the original cake was made with a pound of each of butter, flour, sugar and eggs. And it’s delicious – with a pound of butter and sugar how could it not be – so it is no surprise it has stood the test of time. This cream cheese pound cake recipe is sure to be your new favorite.</span>

        <span>Over the years, bakers have modified and created variations on the original. I’ve made a number of pound cakes including sour cream pound cake, peach pound cake, orange pound cake, and honey bun pound cake. And I love them all. Truly. This moist pound cake recipe makes a rich and delicious cake – one you can serve for breakfast or dessert and at any time in between.</span>
        <span>It’s even better when you top it with homemade whipped cream and fresh berries or diced pineapple. Vanilla ice cream with a drizzle of caramel sauce or hot fudge sauce is also a great way to enjoy this cake.</span>
        <span>Recently, I’ve brushed slices of pound cake with a little bit of oil or melted butter or oil before putting them on the grill or in the grill pan for a couple of minutes per side. This creates a warm slice with a slightly crunchy outside, the most scrumptious base for any toppings you can imagine.</span>
        <span>But honestly, it’s amazing on its own. It’s so moist and flavorful, you really don’t need anything to garnish it.</span>
        <span>This was IT. The recipe that had eluded me for years!</span>

        <span>Difficulty Level of Recipes: Easy. Bundt cakes are known for being pretty simple, and I think all of the recipes fell into that category. As long as you can remember to grease and flour the pan well, you shouldn’t run int any problems.</span>
        <span>Availability of Ingredients: Easy. You should be able to find all of the ingredients in a normal grocery store. In fact, I think I had many of the ingredients for several of the recipes right in my pantry.</span>

        <h2>What’s the purpose of cream cheese in a pound cake?</h2>
        <span>Believe it or not, cream cheese actually lightens up the cake! Pound cake is yummy but the traditional recipe makes for a dense cake. Cream cheese adds moistness to the cake and makes it lighter and a bit airier than the original.</span>
        <h2>What is the trick to making the perfect pound cake?</h2>
        <span>Pound cakes are easy to prepare, but they do require attention. Use the proper flour – cake flour – which will produce a slightly less dense cake. Measure your ingredients correctly, sift the flour, and be patient when mixing everything together.</span>
