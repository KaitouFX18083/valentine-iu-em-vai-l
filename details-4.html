        <span>This month I wanted to tackle a classic chocolate cake that seems ever-so-fitting for celebrating Father’s Day in a couple of weeks. I remember my mom making this cake a couple of times growing up, and I made a previous version nearly seven years ago, but I wanted to revisit the recipe and give it a much-needed facelift. I am confident in telling you that this is the best version of German chocolate cake I’ve ever tried..</span>
        <span>I hope you’ll bake it with me this month! Let’s get started!</span>
        <h2>The History of German Chocolate Cake</h2>
        <span>Up until I first made this cake, I assumed that it originated in Germany, due to its name. Turns out, it’s as American as the Big Mac. Who knew?!</span>
        <span>Way back in 1852, Sam German developed a brand of dark chocolate for Baker’s Chocolate Company and the resulting product, Baker’s German’s Sweet Chocolate, was named in honor of him. Then, in the late 1950’s, the original recipe for “German’s Chocolate Cake”, which used the baking chocolate, was submitted by a homemaker to a local newspaper. It became insanely popular, so much so, that the company that owned Baker’s Chocolate noticed and distributed the recipe to other newspapers across the country. Reportedly, sales of the chocolate increased 73% , and the cake became famous.</span>
        <span>This was IT. The recipe that had eluded me for years!</span>

        <span>German chocolate cake is made with two essential components, and an optional third one. Let’s discuss!</span>
        <span>The three of these work together to create a cake so wonderfully rich, full of texture and flavor, and deserving of being presented for any and all occasions.</span>

        <span>This cake is everything that I expect for a bundt cake. A moist cake with a dense yet tender crumb, this coconut bundt cake has the perfect amount of coconut flavors running through it. And the glaze!! I’ll admit that I’m that person who goes crazy over a simple glaze, and will dip my finger into the puddles of glaze that drip from the cake. (Don’t judge – you know you do it, too.)</span>
        
        <span>Many consider this component optional or not at all necessary since the coconut-pecan filling is certainly rich. I know, I know… “naked” cakes are all the rage right now, but I just cannot, under any circumstance, consider frosting optional. We don’t go crazy here, just frosting the sides and a little decorative border on top, enough to finish it off.</span>
